      ## What is this?


      This is a [TinaCMS](https://tina.io)-enabled Next.js app, so you can edit
      your content on a live page. In this project the Tina file-based CMS is
      used via GraphQL: it's powered by a schema that _you_ define. It not only
      serves content from Markdown files in your repository, but it also
      generates TinaCMS forms for you automatically âœ¨.


      ### Scope


      * Run this project locally using local content within this repository.

      * Connect to Tina Cloud to benefit from its GraphQL Content API.

      * Deploy the site to visually edit your site.

      * Invite collaborators.
